## EEB Analysis Example
```
set.seed(123)

habitat <- rep(c("Forest", "Grassland", "Wetland"), each = 20)  # 3 habitat types, 20 samples each
biomass <- c(rnorm(20, mean = 50, sd = 10),  # Forest: Mean = 50, SD = 10
             rnorm(20, mean = 30, sd = 8),   # Grassland: Mean = 30, SD = 8
             rnorm(20, mean = 40, sd = 9))   # Wetland: Mean = 40, SD = 9

ecology_data <- data.frame(Habitat = habitat, Biomass = biomass)

anova_result <- aov(Biomass ~ Habitat, data = ecology_data)
